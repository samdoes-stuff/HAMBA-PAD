# Before We Begin

🐄 Because Tomorrow is Eid... 🎉
I couldn't just commit code — I had to commit to a cow.

While you're deploying apps, I'm deploying livestock.
While you're pushing to main, I'm pushing hay to a very judgmental bovine.

Yes, tomorrow is Eid, and I bought a cow.
And not just any cow — this one moo-ved my heart and inspired my repo structure.

Now featuring:

CAD files shaped like beefy dreams 🛠️

Rotary encoders spinning faster than uncles after 3 cups of Eid tea ☕

More moo than you can git pull 🐄

| Feature                | Fusion 360 CAD                        | Cow                                            | Reality Check                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shape**              | Perfectly parametric, clean curves    | Curves? More like squiggles & wobbles          | Fusion 360 tries to model squiggles; cow just wobbles for fun! |
| **Behavior**           | Obeys every command, no complaints    | Randomly moos, eats grass, naps a lot          | Cow wins in chill vibes; Fusion 360 wins in “do what I say.”   |
| **Flexibility**        | Can stretch or compress with a click  | Stretches? Only when someone calls dinner time | CAD models obey physics; cows obey hunger.                     |
| **Sound**              | Silent unless you count your keyboard | Loud moos, occasional tail swishes             | Sorry Fusion 360, cows have better volume control.             |
| **Energy consumption** | Requires electricity & caffeine       | Eats grass, naps, and still looks majestic     | Cow is the original eco-friendly machine.                      |
| **Rotary involvement** | Rotates perfectly on digital axes     | Tail rotates randomly, usually to swat flies   | Cow’s rotary = natural antenna; CAD rotary = pure precision.   |

Stretch Goals (because why not?)
Design a cow-shaped Eid lantern with Fusion 360 — because everyone needs a glowing moo at night.

Create a rotary encoder that controls the volume of a virtual cow’s moo. Extra points for adding echo! 🐄🎶

Animate a Fusion 360 model that “stretches” like a cow trying to reach the last bite of grass.
