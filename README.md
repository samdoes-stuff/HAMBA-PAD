# Before We Begin

🐄 Cow vs. CAD: An Eid ul Adha Special
(A Macro Pad Built on Sacrifice and Sudden Realizations)

python
while not fusion_360_sketch_working:
    if cow_is_ready:
        celebrate_eid()  # Mandatory
    else:
        panic_optimize_macro_pad_code()  # Also mandatory

  📜 README.md: Pre-Eid Chaos Edition
🔴🟢🟡 Project Status Lights
🟢 Cow Procurement: Success! (Bargaining skills: legendary)

🟡 Macro Pad: "It compiles... sometimes"

🔴 Fusion 360 Progress: "Why does ‘Extrude’ hate me?"

📊 Cow vs. CAD: The Ultimate Comparison
Category	The Cow 🐄	Fusion 360 🖥️
Cost	Significant investment	"Free" (but costs sanity)
Documentation	Centuries of Islamic tradition	"YouTube tutorials from 2016"
Error Messages	"Moo?" (understandable)	"Sketch is over-constrained" (???)
Output	Nutritious meat	Existential dread
My Skill Level	Can identify legs/head	Can draw rectangles (sometimes)
🎛️ Rotary Encoder: Life Advice Mode
(Troubleshooting tips disguised as wisdom)

"If it jitters, you’re turning too fast – just like life."

Fix: Add KC.MACRO_SLEEP_MS(50) to your decisions.

"Clockwise for volume, counter-clockwise for regrets."

Default mapping: VOLU/VOLD, but CTRL+Z is acceptable too.

"Press to pause – works on music AND existential crises."

🎯 Pre-Eid To-Do List
🕋 Morning: Eid prayers + qurbani

🍖 Afternoon: Meat distribution + family time

⌨️ Evening: Attempt to extrude one (1) sketch before iftar

Stretch goal: Make the OLED display show "Eid Mubarak!"
